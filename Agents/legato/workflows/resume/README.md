# Resume Workflow

This workflow focuses on resume structuring.

Current intended flow:

```text
resume file
  -> PDF text-layer fast path or MarkItDown fallback
  -> cleaning
  -> Presto formatter
  -> resume JSON
```

This directory is the place for workflow-specific prompts, schemas, examples, and acceptance notes.

## Current Contract

The first workflow contract is intentionally narrow:

- Extract `identity`.
- Extract `education`.
- Extract `certifications_awards`.
- Extract `experience`.
- Enrich education schools with local ranking tags.
- Add normalized `degree_level` for every education item.
- `identity` contains `name`, `birth_year`, and `sex`.
- `sex` may be `""` when not found.
- Run field extraction concurrently.
- Each field extractor must return a JSON object.
- If a field output is not valid JSON or misses the requested field, retry.
- Maximum retries: `5`.
- Final workflow output is JSON:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "name": "陈曦",
    "birth_year": "2002",
    "sex": "男"
  },
  "education": [
    {
      "school": "东北农业大学",
      "degree": "本科",
      "degree_level": "本科",
      "major": "计算机科学与技术",
      "department": "电气与信息学院",
      "school_tags": {
        "matched_school": "东北农业大学",
        "is_985": false,
        "is_211": true,
        "is_double_first_class": true,
        "ruanke_rank": 120
      }
    }
  ],
  "certifications_awards": [
    {
      "name": "全国大学英语六级考试",
      "result": "567分"
    },
    {
      "name": "2023年全国大学生数学建模竞赛 黑龙江赛区",
      "result": "一等奖"
    }
  ],
  "experience": [
    {
      "type": "实习",
      "role": "前端开发实习生",
      "contribution": "在高新兴参与视频云平台监控前台系统开发。",
      "level": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

## Prompt Layout

```text
prompts/common.md      shared short rules for JSON and accuracy
prompts/profile.md     identity + education in one request
prompts/certifications_awards.md certificates and awards
prompts/item_benchmark.md six-dimensional item scoring
prompts/major_baseline.md major-family academic baseline scoring
prompts/job_matching.md agent-team job recommendation and target radar
prompts/combined.md    profile + certifications_awards + experience in one request
prompts/merge.md       final schema merge
prompts/retry_json.md  short retry instruction for invalid JSON
schema.json            first-version output schema
```

First-version concurrency:

```text
profile agent ----------------\
certifications_awards agent --+-- local school tags + local experience -> merge -> validate -> JSON
```

`certifications_awards` does not receive the full resume by default. It first uses a broad keyword recall step and keeps matched lines plus nearby context. If the recalled candidate text is too short, it falls back to the full resume.

Experience is generated locally in the first version to avoid an extra high-latency model request. It uses resume text plus `certifications_awards` to produce work/project, contest, and campus-role entries.
To avoid double counting, `experience` keeps only described work/project/role/contest entries with contribution text. Undescribed competitions and certificates stay only in `certifications_awards`.
`role` is optional, but when available it should prefer `organization/company/event / role`, for example `字节跳动 / MCP标注(实习生)` or `杜邦青年创新大赛 / 队长`. For projects without a clear organization or title, keep `role` as `""` instead of fabricating one.
`contribution` should be a short ability-focused contribution summary. It should avoid repeating the organization/event name and focus on what the student did in that experience.
Ability assessment should rely primarily on `contribution` and `level`.

Education school tags are generated locally from `cache/ruanke_china_university_ranking_2026_structured.json`. Matching uses exact school name first, then a conservative contains match for extracted names such as `东北农业大学 · 本科`.
Before ranking matching, `cache/independent_colleges.json` is checked for independent colleges or similar standalone entities that should not inherit the parent university's ranking tags. For example, `杭州电子科技大学信息工程学院` is treated as its own institution, while normal internal departments such as `东北农业大学电气与信息学院` can still inherit the parent school tag.
Each education item gets `degree_level` as one of `专科` / `本科` / `硕士` / `博士` / `""`. If there is only one education item and its degree is missing, the local `education_degree_inference_agent` infers it from study years and school name, defaulting toward `本科`.

Comparison mode:

```text
combined agent -> validate -> JSON
```

Use `--workflow-combine-agents` to compare single-request latency with the concurrent path.

No contact extraction in this workflow version.

## Item Benchmark

`--workflow-stage item_benchmark` benchmarks evidence items concurrently through Presto.
The recommended production path is to run it after `experience_hybrid`, with caller-assembled items passed by `--workflow-stage-input`.
If no input file is provided, it falls back to extracting `certifications_awards` first for CLI compatibility.
Each item request includes an education context summary: school, degree level, major, and research direction lines when present.

Input shape:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {"kind": "award", "key": "award:0", "name": "", "result": "", "level": 0, "evidence_scope": "校外"},
    {"kind": "experience", "key": "experience:0", "type": "", "role": "", "contribution": "", "level": 0, "evidence_scope": "校内"}
  ]
}
```

Each output item contains:

- `item`: original item identity, including `kind`, `key`, `name`, `result`, `evidence_scope`, and experience fields when provided.
- `dimensions`: fixed order `逻辑`, `语言`, `专业`, `领导`, `抗压`, `成长`.
- `scores`: normalized six-dimensional weight vector, each value in `0.0-1.0`, and the six values sum to `1.0`.
- `impact_factor`: `0-10`, similar to `experience.level`, measuring how strongly the item proves ability.

`evidence_scope` is `校内` only for school, college, class, student-union, society, internal honor, or campus project evidence. Certificates, internships, company evidence, public competitions, regional/provincial/national awards, and unclear external organizers are `校外`.

Dimension definitions:

- `逻辑`: math, science, analysis, modeling, and problem-solving ability.
- `语言`: writing, communication, presentation, and humanities expression.
- `专业`: ability related to the student's major or technical field.
- `领导`: leadership, ownership, organization, and team influence.
- `抗压`: pressure, difficulty, persistence, and delivery under constraints.
- `成长`: learning potential, initiative, improvement, and exploration.

`impact_factor` considers contest or organizer value, participation depth, technical evidence in the description, company/organization credibility, and how meaningful the item is for the student's education level, school tier, degree, and major.

## Major Baseline

`--workflow-stage major_baseline` evaluates how the student's major and academic record should set the six-dimensional academic prior before item evidence is added.
It is intended to run together with `item_benchmark` after `profile` has returned. The backend passes `basic_info`, `education`, and `transcript_use` through `--workflow-stage-input`; the prompt then adds compact Markdown education context through a `{{context}}` slot.

Output shape:

```json
{
  "major_baseline": {
    "major_name": "计算机科学与技术",
    "major_family": "工科类",
    "base_score": 51,
    "dimensions": ["逻辑", "语言", "专业", "领导", "抗压", "成长"],
    "scores": [56, 46, 59, 42, 49, 53],
    "rationale": "按工科类专业、211/双一流/软科#120学校层次给出能力prior。",
    "confidence": 0.68,
    "source": "presto_major_baseline"
  }
}
```

`major_family` is one of `文科类`, `理科类`, `工科类`, `商科类`, `医农类`, `艺术体育类`, `交叉类`, or `未知`.
The model uses thinking mode internally but must return only JSON. If Presto or the model fails, the stage returns an error so the caller can retry instead of silently mixing in a local fallback.
School tier is passed as context from the local ranking cache: `985`, `211`, `双一流`, and `ruanke_rank`.
It is a visible prior: `985`/top-50 receives a clear positive adjustment, `211`/`双一流`/top-150 receives a moderate positive adjustment, and non-双一流 schools below top-150 receive a small-to-medium debuff by rank bucket.
Independent colleges, private colleges, and former third-tier colleges are treated as separate institutions and should not inherit the parent university's `985` / `211` / ranking tags. With missing GPA or an average around 80, their academic prior is normally around 38-43.
When multiple education records exist, the stage should not simply pick the strongest school. A later master's degree can partially offset a weak undergraduate school, but an independent/private/former-third-tier undergraduate background remains a negative academic-prior signal.
If the school has a clear field specialty or the context mentions `王牌专业` / `特色专业` / `优势专业` / `一流学科`, the stage can slightly raise `专业` and adjacent dimensions, but it should not erase the school-tier debuff.
The scores are ability priors, not raw grade scores. A missing GPA or transcript average near 80 maps to an ability prior around 50.

## Job Matching

`--workflow-stage job_matching` runs after `item_benchmark` and `major_baseline`.
The backend passes `basic_info`, `education`, `major_baseline`, `awards`, and `experiences` through `--workflow-stage-input`.
The prompt uses an agent team protocol: Capability Strategist, Evidence Auditor, Education Gatekeeper, Role Mapper, Ranking Arbiter, and Report Writer.

Ranking principles:

- Six-dimensional ability fit is the first ranking signal.
- Experience relevance and evidence quality are the second ranking signal.
- Education is a threshold and risk gate, not the only ranking signal.
- A high impact and highly relevant project can partially break the education threshold, but the result must expose risk and next proof.
- Recommendations should consider both major-related roles and cross-major transferable roles when the evidence supports them.

Output includes:

```json
{
  "job_matching": {
    "target_role": "前端开发工程师",
    "overall_match": 81,
    "match_level": "高潜力匹配",
    "student_radar": [{"name": "逻辑", "score": 72}],
    "target_radar": [{"name": "逻辑", "score": 76}],
    "selected_job": {"rank": 1, "title": "前端开发工程师", "requirement_radar": []},
    "top_jobs": [],
    "report_sections": [],
    "gap_details": [],
    "recommendations": []
  }
}
```

Frontend radar aggregation uses the current item scores:

- Evidence strength = `0.4 * level/10 + 0.6 * impact_factor/10`.
- Per-dimension contribution = `six_dim_score * evidence_strength`, capped at `0.96`.
- Multiple items combine with strong diminishing returns: after evidence score reaches about 65, marginal gain drops below 16%; after about 70, marginal gain is about 4%.
- Low-confidence evidence is capped twice: each item has a low contribution cap, and its bucket has a strict per-dimension total cap. Current capped buckets include untitled professional projects, campus/internal awards, low-impact awards/basic certificates, and generic campus roles. Quantity cannot replace concrete project titles, strong competitions, internships, or measured outcomes.
- Final ability uses `school_tier_prior + evidence_lift`, not a simple evidence/baseline blend. School tier sets the base and ceiling; evidence can only add within that ceiling.
- Ceiling is tiered: 985/top-50 can reach the highest band with high-impact evidence; 211/双一流 is lower; non-双一流 and ordinary schools have tighter caps; independent/private/former-third-tier backgrounds require B3/B4 evidence to break out and usually only approach the basic band of a 双一流 student. A later stronger degree can partially offset this prior, but does not erase the undergraduate signal.
- Three radar series are rendered: `综合` over all items plus school-tier academic prior, `校内` over campus/internal items plus school-tier academic prior, and `校外` over external items constrained by the same school-tier ceiling.

For DeepSeek thinking mode, run Presto with:

```sh
PRESTO_THINKING=enabled PRESTO_REASONING_EFFORT=high go run ./cmd/presto
```

The final JSON does not expose chain-of-thought; the model is instructed to use brief internal reasoning and return only scores.

## Experience Level

`experience.level` is a 0-10 numeric score:

Detailed scoring rules live in `SCORING_RUBRIC.md`.

- `9-10`: rare, high-signal experience with national/top-tier context and clear core ownership.
- `7-8`: strong technical/research/contest experience with clear ownership and meaningful output.
- `5-6`: normal internship/project/campus leadership with concrete contribution but limited signal.
- `3-4`: low-technical-content work such as labeling, audit, simple correction, or routine participation.
- `1-2`: weak evidence or mostly title-only experience.
- `0`: invalid or unusable experience.

Pure award lines without contribution descriptions are not scored here; they remain in `certifications_awards`.
Company brand or contest name alone is not enough for a high score. Formal contests should be judged by scope, award, and technical relevance; concrete school-level technical projects can score mid-high but should not reach the top tier. Basic certificates and generic honors such as 三好学生, 优秀学生干部, and routine computer certificates carry low value. Outsourced/labeling-style internships should stay conservative unless the text proves substantial technical ownership.
